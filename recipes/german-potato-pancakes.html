    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These German potato pancakes are a nice change from regular pancakes.</p>
    <p>They make a great dinner meal when served with Bratwurst sausage.</p>
    <p>I spread mine with cranberry sauce and top with maple syrup.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>0.25 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>0.25 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>6 medium potatoes, peeled and shredded</li>
      <li>0.5 cup finely chopped onion</li>
      <li>0.25 cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Beat eggs, flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl; stir in potatoes and onion.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of potato mixture into hot oil in batches. Press to flatten. Cook until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining potato mixture.</li>
    </ol>
